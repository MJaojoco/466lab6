pageRank.py stores the implementation for my pageRank algorithm. It takes in either 
epsilon or iterations depending on the format of the file that stores the graph.
It returns the pageRank of each node in the graph in descending order, 
as well as the number of iterations and the time it took to 
    1. construct the graph and 2. calculate pageRank

usage: python3 pageRank.py <filename> <iterations/epsilon> <small/snap>
    <small/snap> is a string that represents the format of the data. 
    <iterations/epsilon> is an integer/float representing the corresponding variable
        iterations is used for small formatted data
        epsilon is used for snap formatted data

note: the algorithm always attempts the snap format if anything other than 
    "small" is provided for the final argument
